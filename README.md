# Proverbs Daily

A mobile app that delivers a verse from the book of Proverbs in the bible daily.

 

## Run Locally 
- Ensure Flutter, android studio and xcode are installed
- run `flutter doctor` and if you get a 'no issues found' message you're set to go. 
- Clone the repo
- run `flutter pub get` in the root of the folder to ensure all dependencies are installed
- run `flutter run` or click the play button in your IDE of choice

## Please note: 
- The app is not on any app store nor does it push notifications.
- the app is currently served by a backend I wrote. The backend is hosted on Heroku. 
- Please use responsibly. I reserve the right to shut down the server at any point
- The backend is open-sourced so you can clone the repo and host it yourself- [Proverbs Daily Backend](https://github.com/akinfelami/proverbs-daily-backend).

As a suggestion, cron currently schedules a new verse at midnight. Feel free to edit this to test your code. Read more here https://pub.dev/packages/cron
